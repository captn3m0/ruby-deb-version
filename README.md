# Debian Version (Ruby)

A port of "Debian Version" comparison function to Ruby. This is based on 
[Debian Policy Manual v4.6.20, Section 5.6.12](https://www.debian.org/doc/debian-policy/ch-controlfields.html#version).

It adapts some of the code from https://github.com/FauxFaux/deb-version and https://github.com/xolox/python-deb-pkg-tools

## Installation

Install the gem and add to the application's Gemfile by executing:

    $ bundle add deb_version

If bundler is not being used to manage dependencies, install the gem by executing:

    $ gem install deb_version

## Usage

```ruby
require 'deb_version'
v1 = DebVersion::DebianVersion.new("1.3~rc2")
v2 = DebVersion::DebianVersion.new("1.3")
v1 < v2 # true
```

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and the created tag, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).

Run `bundle exec rake rubocop` to check for style violations.

Run `bundle exec rake test` to run tests.
